    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>Education is the backbone of a country. Education is like a burning lamp through which one is able to see himself
        and the world around him.

        Life becomes valueless without education. Education makes one self reliant and develops ones self confidence as
        knowledge is believed to be power.
        Education begins at home and in the process of Education ones mind gets opened up. After receiving informal
        Education the child enters school to receive formal education. The true function of Education is to build an
        integrated personality. Education does not mean accumulation of knowledge. The mind should learn to deem and
        discriminate. Education is a lifelong process.</p>

    <h2>Transport Service</h2>
    <p>The school bus is one of the most loved forms of transportation to school. The school buses of today are designed
        in such a way that they are more durable and more conscientiously maintained. Most school buses come in crush
        size and height standards and bright colors, with cross-view mirrors and reinforced sides for added safety. They
        also have stop sign arms and flashing red lights.

        School bus drivers are also screened and required to undergo special training that involve ensuring their young
        passengersâ€™ safety and security, first aid and medical procedures, road safety, and other important concerns.
        They are also required to undergo testing for drug and alcohol consumption as well as driving record checks.
        Traffic laws are implemented specifically for school bus transport to make sure that students are protected.</p>
